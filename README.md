### Welcome!

## I am a CS student interested in:

- 🕹️ Game Development: engine architectures (ECS) and algorithms, particuarly those for procedural content generation.
- 🐫 Compilers and Programming Languages: Toy compilers, DSL interpreters, and now type inference algorithms/formalisms!
- 📈 Graph Theory: Graph algorithm implementor (st-orientations, graph rewriting, graph drawing, etc...)
- Other miscellaneous topics! (stay tuned)

## Current projects:

- 🐫 Part of the type theory working group for the [sslang research project](https://github.com/ssm-lang/sslang).
- 🕷️ Web crawler as part of my internship with the [Columbia Build Lab](https://www.columbiabuildlab.com/) (private repository)
- 💎 [Bindings for the Open Dynamics Engine library in mruby](https://github.com/jar2333/mruby-ode)
