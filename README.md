### Welcome!

## I am a CS student interested in:

- 🕹️ Game Development: engine architectures (ECS) and algorithms, particuarly those for procedural content generation.
- 🐫 Compilers and Programming Languages: Toy compilers, DSL interpreters, and now type inference algorithms/formalisms!
- 📈 Graph Theory: Graph algorithm implementor (st-orientations, graph rewriting, graph drawing, etc...)
- 🚧 Other miscellaneous topics! (stay tuned)

## Current projects:

- 🐫 Part of the type theory working group for the [sslang research project](https://github.com/ssm-lang/sslang), working on pretty-printing tools for the type system's constraint solver.
- 🕷️ Web crawler as part of my internship with the [Columbia Build Lab](https://www.columbiabuildlab.com/) (private repository)
- 💎 [Bindings for the Open Dynamics Engine library in mruby](https://github.com/jar2333/mruby-ode)
- λ   An interpreter for a standalone relational programming language inspired by [microKanren](https://doi.org/10.1145/2989225.2989230), implemented using [Huet's algorithm for unification of lambda terms](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/sar/SS20/5.pdf) with [a backtracking monad transformer](https://doi.org/10.1145/1090189.1086390).
- ✏️ Sketcher: a sketch drawing classifier using graph-based analysis and indexing.
