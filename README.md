## I have an interest in:

- 🌐 Web development: Ruby on Rails, Django, React, RESTful APIs, Microservices, Cloud (AWS)
- 🕹️ Game Development: engine architectures (ECS) and algorithms, particuarly those for procedural content generation.
- 🐫 Compilers and Programming Languages: Toy compilers, DSL interpreters, and now type inference algorithms/formalisms!
- 📈 Graph Theory: Graph algorithm implementation (st-orientations, graph rewriting, graph drawing, etc...)
- 🚧 Other miscellaneous topics! (stay tuned)
